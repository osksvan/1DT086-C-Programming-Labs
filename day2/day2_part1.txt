This one required a bit of thought. Reading the example matrix was easy, but the real input data had different number of columns on each row.
I solved that issue by checking the maximum number of columns in the real input data (8) and always tried to read 8 numbers from each row, when failing
 a read I filled up the rest of the row with INT_MAX to be able to see them as blanks later.

Checking which lines were "safe" was easy, just compare each value with the previous on the line. The first and second value of each row 
determined if the values should be increasing or decreasing, and then all values were checked to be within +-3 of the previous one.
