This one was tricky, and I ended up more or less brute-forcing it with lots of for-loops. Not the prettiest code, but it worked well.

The part 1 task was a row with values where they could increase or decrease by a maximum of 3 for the entire line. So 1, 3, 4 is okay but 3, 1, 4 is not.
In part 2 I was allowed to remove ONE element per row if that would make the row pass the check. To do this, I first check the original row, and if that fails 
I start by removing (shifting the row). In the above example it would be that removing the 3 would allow 1, 4 to pass the checks. So I loop over all the numbers
on each row and try the checks with each number removed. I modified only a copy of the original matrix that I read from file.
The input in part 2 was the same, but I added a buffer column with INT_MAX at the end in order to be able to removing the last element
from each row since I was working with shifting arr[i] = arr[i+1] and needed a bit more room.
