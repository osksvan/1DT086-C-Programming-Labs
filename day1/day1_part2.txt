Part 2 of day 1 was just chaning the summation part to loop through the two arrays in two nestled loops.
The first loop is used to go through the first array, picking out each number as the number to look for in the second array.
The second loop goes through the second array in order to see how many times the number occurs in the second array.
Then it adds the_number * number_of_occurences to the total sum.
