For day one, you got a big list of numbers in two columns, and I had to read them from file. 
While I could have declared a static array of the values, I wanted to read them from file, 
because that is easier than modifying the list of numbers by hand. It also allowed
me to alternate between the example inputs and the real inputs, for debugging. 
Interacting with files was simple, as I've done it before in both C, C#, Java an Python - open fp, read, close fp.

The first tricky part was reading out the data, at first I thought to read from each row twice, once for each number on the row, 
but then found that the fscanf function supports reading multiple values at once.

The second tricky part was using the qsort function, which itself is easy, but I had to refresh my pointer knowledge to write the compare function for it.
I wanted to sort the arrays before calculating the differences because that meant that the elements at index n in the arrays were always the n:th smallest.
Otherwise I would have had to loop through the entire length of the array multiple times and replace the then-smallest value with null/INT_MAX and handle that.
